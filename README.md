The website I am developping aims to mitigate the problems that occur in academic research dissemination. 
In order to publish research, professors must go through 3rd publishing companies that charge absurd mark-ups to view journal articles. 
the professors frequently do not see this money and quality research becomes extremely taxxing and laborious.

This website will solve this problem by allowing all publishers to make their articles publicly available for all to read.
It will also streamline peer review by allowing reviews to be done on the website, directly attached to the paper and publicly accessible. 



The website will be used to/for: access research papers, text editting tools, QuickCite features, and small chat rooms. All accessible through the same browser window.

I intend to build a server for the text data storage. A server for user-logins and user- "profiles" to which there will be data appended describing their accolades or contributions.
